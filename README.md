### How to fetch assignment revisions

First of all, the easiest way is to copy and paste the revised content to your assignment.

But however, if you want to learn a bit more about git commands. It is what you need

```sh
# commit all changes first
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ucdavis-sta141c-sq-2020/assignment-x.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master --allow-unrelated-histories
# then resolve any potential conflicts and commit the resolved conflict
```
